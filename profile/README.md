<!--## Hi there üëã-->

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

# Welcome to the Blue Bark Network üêæ
the goal of this org is to have a collective of furry programmers indicated by an org badge or their profile. I want to make it easy to find furry programmers by simply exploring this org.

It is simple to join the Blue Bark Network, simply open a discussion in the badge request section and you will be added to the network(manually). 
Also post as many projects as you want in the show and tell. You don't have to make commits and repos in the network, but you can if you REALLY want to. It is better to stick to keeping those on a personal page.

Discord Server COMING SOON‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, it will be a hub for all things blue bark, as this is far from the only phase of the project.

That is all, thanks for stopping by :3
